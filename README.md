Hello!

This is a small project I worked on using Java to create a calculator from scratch.

For this project, I used a text field to display and get numbers and such, filtering them with a custom document filter. 
The calculator should be able to handle button-only inputs and keyboard-only (or both), as I also added keybindings to link 
the respective keys with their button and function. 

I enjoyed making this project since I learned some new things in Java like the filter, etc, but in the future, I realized that there are
more efficient methods for doing a project like this.
