Hello!

This is a small project I worked on using Java to create a calculator from scratch.

For this project I used a textfield to display and get numbers and such, filtering them with a custom document filter. 
The calculator should be able to handle button-only inputs as well as keyboard-only (or both) as I also added keybindings to link 
the respective keys with their button and function. 

I enjoyed this making this project since I learned some new things in java like the filter, etc, but in the future I realized that there are
definently more efficient methods to making a project like this.
